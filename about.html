    <h1>How it all Started</h1>
    <p class='quote'>"When Martha and I eventually settled down, we talked amongst ourselves and came to realize that there really
      is a need for pure, 100%, white-spotted brown cow produced milk. We should do something about that."<br>
      <span class='align-right'>- Jeff Jefferson, Owner and Founder of We Sell Milk</span><br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it was, Jeff and Martha founded We Sell Milk based on the sole principle of using exclusivley brown colored
      cows with white spots to produce that signature We Sell Milk taste. 35 years later, the We Sell Dairy farm was established in 2018 to provide
      a steady flow of legally sourced milk rather than secretly milking brown cows with white spots from other local cow pastures.

    <h1>The #milkgang</h1>
    <p class='quote'>"The #milkgang is like a movement, really. We're one big family that strives towards a better society for all, and to us,
      that starts with milk."<br>
      <span class='align-right'>- Jeff Jefferson, Owner and Founder of We Sell Milk</span><br><br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning Jeff has always strived to put the people first.
      The customers, which he likes to reffer to as the "#milkgang", are what really bring the We Sell Milk community together. From homegrown
      dairy farm, to worldwide milk sensation (hopefully), it's the people that make us who we are.</p>
